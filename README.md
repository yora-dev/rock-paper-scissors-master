## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (for game logic)

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my **JavaScript logic building skills** and improve my ability to structure interactive UIs.

Some highlights:

- Managing **game state** and updating the DOM dynamically
- Creating **randomized computer choices**
- Implementing a **score system** that updates correctly

### Continued development

- In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:
- Implement localStorage to persist the score across sessions
- Add the bonus version (Lizard & Spock)
- Improve animations for game results and transitions

### Useful resources

- MDN Math.random()
